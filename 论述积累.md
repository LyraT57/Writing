> On the one hand, efforts are undoubtedly expected in conventional wisdom. This can be best understood through some old proverbs and idioms, such as "Hard work makes up for deficiency" and "Perseverance can overcome all difficulties". On the other hand, this wisdom could never negate the necessity of respecting rules, or in other words, preclude methods. For example, reflecting the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, we know it is the flow law of water that scientists recognize, which turns harm into a benefit.

> 翻译：一方面，在传统观念中，“努力”无疑是被期待的。通过一些古老的习语，可以很好地理解这一点，比如“勤能补拙”、“水滴石穿”。然而，这种观念不能否定尊重规律的必要性，或者换句话说，不能将方法排除在外。比如，反思三峡大坝的修建，我们知道，正是科学家认识到水的流动规律，才变害为利。
