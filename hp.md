Dear Mr. Potter,  
 
We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your  
place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.  
 
As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells  
outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to  
expulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of  
Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).  
 
We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that  
risks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is  
a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation  
of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy.  
 
Enjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Potter,
　　We have received intelligence that you performed the Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle.
　　The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.
　　As you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under Section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic at 9 a.m. on the twelfth of August.
　　Hoping you are well,
　　Yours sincerely,
　　Mafalda Hopkirk
　　Improper Use of Magic Office
Ministry of Magic


Dear Mr Potter,
　　Further to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith. You may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of August, at which time an official decision will be taken.
　　Following discussions with the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from- school pending further enquiries.
　　With best wishes,
　　Yours sincerely,
　　Mafalda Hopkirk

Dear Harry,  
 
I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have  
a cup of tea with me around three?  
 
I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with  
Hedwig.  
 
Hagrid

Dear Ron,  
 
How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian  
Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing 

 


Dear Ron, and Harry if you're there,  
 
        "`I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that  
you didn't do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would  
get Harry into trouble, too. I've been really worried and if Harry is all  
right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be bet  
ter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might  
finish your one off.  
 
"'I'm very busy with schoolwork, of course'- How can she be?" said Ron  
in horror. "We're on vacation! - 'and we're going to London next  
Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don't we meet in Diago n Alley?  
 
"`Let me know what's happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione.  
"'  
 
"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,"  
said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. "What're you all up to  
today?"  

Dear Harry,  
 
Happy birthday!  
 
Look, I' really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles  
didn't give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn't  
have shouted.  
 
It's amazing here in Egypt. Bill's taken us around all the tombs and you  
wouldn't believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum  
wouldn't let Ginny come in the last one. There were all these mutant  
skeletons in there, of Muggles who'd broken in and grown extra heads and  
stuff.  
 
I couldn't believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven hundred  
galleons! Most of it's gone on this trip, but they're going to buy me a  
new wand for next year.  

Dear Harry,  
 
Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I  
do hope you're all right.  
 
I'm on holiday in France at the moment and I didn't know how I was going  
to send this to you -- what if they'd opened it at customs? -- but then  
Hedwig turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got something for  
Dear Harry,  
 
Happy Birthday!  
 
Think you might find this useful for next year. Won't say no more here.  
Tell you when I see you. Hope the Muggles are treating you right.  
 
All the best,  
 
Hagrid  

Dear Mr. Hagrid,  
 
Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in  
your class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that  
you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.  
  
However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question.  
We have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy,  
and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the  
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April  
20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the  
Committee's offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the  
hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated. Yours in fellowship...  
 
There followed a list of the school governors.  

Dear Harry and Ron, How Abut having tea with me this afternoon 'round  
six? I'll come collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE  
HALL; YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. Cheers, Hagrid  

Dear Hermione, We lost. I'm allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts.  
Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London. I won't forget all  
the help you gave us.  
 
Hagrid  

Dear Harry,  
 
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don't know  
whether they're used to owl post.  
 
Buckbeak and I are in hiding. I won't tell you where, in case this owl  
falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, but  
he is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.  
 
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven't a  
 
hope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse  
me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle  
will be lifted.  
 
There is something I never got around to telling you during our brief  
meeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt --  

Dear Sirius,  
         Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly get through  
my window. Things are the same as usual here. Dudley's diet isn't going too well. My  
aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him they'd have  
to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his  
PlayStation out of the window. That's a sort of computer thing you can play games on.  
Bit stupid really, now he hasn't even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off  
things.  
         I'm okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn  
them all into bats if I ask you to.  
         A weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar hurt again. Last time that  
happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don't reckon he can be  
anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years  
afterward?  
         I'll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she's off hunting at the moment.  
Say hello to Buckbeak for me. Harry 

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,  
         We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great deal from  
Harry about my son Ron.  
        As Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch World Cup takes place  
this Monday night, and my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets  
through his connections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports.  
        I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as this really is a once-in-  
a-lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn't hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are  
extremely hard to come by.      We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for the  
remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to school.  
        It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the  
normal way, because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and I am not  
sure he even knows where it is.  
        Hoping to see Harry soon,  
         Yours sincerely,  
        Molly Weasley  
 
P.S.  I do hope we've put enough stamps on. 

 Dear Sirius,  
                I reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to  
                you last time.  There’s no point coming back, everything’s fine here.  
                Don’t worry about me, my head feels completely normal.  
                          Harry    

 Dear Sirius,  
                 You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts, so here  
                goes - I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard Tournament’s  
                happening this year and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth  

----------------------- Page 1082-----------------------

                champion. I don’t who put my name in the Goblet of Fire, because I  
                didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory,       from Hufflepuff  
 
 
                Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak      - Harry  

 Dear Harry,  
                           Congratulations on getting past the Horntail.          Whoever put your  
                  name in that goblet shouldn't be feeling too happy right now!             I was going  
                  to suggest a Conjunctivitus Curse, as a dragon's eyes are its weakest point  
                  - "That's what Krum did!" Hermione whispered - but your way was better,  
                  I'm impressed.  
                           Don't get complacent, though. Harry.         You've only done one task;  
                  whoever put you in for the tournament's got plenty more opportunity if  
                  they're trying to hurt you.     Keep your eyes open -particularly when the  
                  person we discussed is around and concentrate on keeping yourself out of  
                  trouble.  
                           Keep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual.  
                                     Sirius  


Dear Snuffles,
　　Hope you're OK, the first week back here's been terrible, I'm really glad it's the weekend.
　　We've got a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge. She's nearly as nice as your mum. I'm writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge.
　　We're all missing our biggest friend, we hope he'll be back soon.
　　Please write back quickly.
　　Best,
　　Harry

Dear Ron,
　　I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister for Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor Umbridge) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect.
　　I was most pleasantly surprised when f heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations. I must admit that I have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the 'Fred and George' route, rather than following in my footsteps, so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility.
　　But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, I want to give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post. Hopefully, you will be able 'o read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions.
　　From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternisation with that boy. Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this - no doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore's favourite - but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different - and probably more accurate - view of Potter's behaviour. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowing - and see if you can spot yours truly!
　　Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school, too. As you must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He got off on a mere technicality, if you ask me, and many of the people I've spoken to remain convinced of his guilt.
　　It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter - I know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent - but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything else in Potter's behaviour that is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores Umbridge, a truly delightful woman who I know will be only too happy to advise you.
　　This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted above, Dumbledore's regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your loyalty, Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Ministry. I am very sorry to hear that, so far, Professor Umbridge is encountering very little co-operation from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although she should find this easier from next week - again, see the Daily Prophet tomorrow!). I shall say only this - a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well-placed for Head Boy ship in a couple of years!
　　I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. It pains me to criticise our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore. (If you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore's, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders.) I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people - the Minister really could not be more gracious to me - and I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents' beliefs and actions, either. I sincerely hope that, in time, they will realise how mistaken they were and I shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes.
　　Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly the bit about Harry Potter, and congratulations again on becoming prefect.
　　Your brother,
　　Percy

Dear Harry, 



   If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive this 

   coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort you to the Burrow, where you have 

   been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays. 



   If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter 

   to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow. I shall explain this 

   more fully when I see you. 



   Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to see you this 

   Friday, 



   I am yours most sincerely, 



   Albus Dumbledore 
Dear Harry, 

   I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along 

   to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at 

   school. 



    Yours sincerely, 



   Albus Dumbledore 

 Dear Harry, Ron and Hermione! 



   Aragog died last night. Harry and Ron, you met him and you know how 

   special he was. 

   Hermione, I know you'd have liked him. 

   It would mean a lot to me if you'd nip down for the burial later this 

   evening. 

   I'm planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day. 

   I know you're not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak. 

   Wouldn't ask, but I can't face it alone. 

   Hagrid 

Dear Padfoot, 



          Thank you,  thank you,  for Harry’s birthday present!          It was his 



      favorite  by  far. One  year  old  and  already  zooming  along  on  a  toy 



      broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself. I’m enclosing a picture 



      so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground but 



      he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent 



      me  for  Christmas  (no  complaints  there).     Of  course  James  thought 



      it was so funny,  says he’s going to be a great Quidditch player,  but 



      we’ve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don’t 



      take our eyes off him when he gets going. 



          We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda who 



      has  always  been  sweet  to  us  and  who  dotes  on  Harry.     We  were  so 



      sorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s got to come first, and Harry’s 



      not old enough to know it’s his birthday anyway!  James is getting a 



      bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell—also 



      Dumbledore’s  still  got  his  Invisibility  Cloak,  so  no  chance  of  little 



      excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy 



      was  here  last  weekend.     I  thought  he  seemed  down,  but  that  was 



      probably the next about the McKinnons;  I cried all evening when I 



      heard. 



          Bathilda drops in most days,  she’s a fascinating old thing with

      the  most  amazing  stories  about  Dumbledore.     I’m  not  sure  he’d  be 



      pleased if he knew!    I don’t know how much to believe,  actually be-
