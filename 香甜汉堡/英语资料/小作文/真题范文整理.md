Jane Eyre is considered a classic because it goes against the social norms of the time period. <br/><strong>This leading character</strong> is headstrong and very independent. She is not willing to bend to the will of her caretaker, her headmaster, or even the man she loves, which was certainly not expected considering the conventions back then. Women at that time were supposed to be submissive and get married as soon as someone asks them. <strong>The feminist views she exhibits </strong>show up throughout history in women who believe that they deserve to be the equals of men. <br/>I hope that my brief introduction to the novel will<br/><strong> arouse your interest and motivation to learn more about it</strong>.
