珠算的精准性和独特的运算思维仍有一定的应用。

The accuracy and unique computational thinking of the abacus still have certain applications.

珠算有着悠久的历史。
它萌芽于商周时期，
当时人们在生产劳动中，
计数需求逐渐增，
开始有了简单的计算方法。
而早期的算筹可以看作是珠算的前身。
在秦汉时期，
算筹得到了广泛应用。
随着社会经济的发展，
计算量不断增大，
到了东汉徐岳所著的《数术记遗》中，
就有了对珠算的记载，
这标志着珠算开始逐渐成形。

Abacus has a long history.
It sprouted during the Shang and Zhou dynasties,
At that time, people were engaged in productive labour,
The demand for counting is gradually increasing,
A simple calculation method has begun to emerge.
The early abacus can be seen as the predecessor of the abacus.
During the Qin and Han dynasties,
Computational chips have been widely used.
With the development of the social economy,
The computational workload continues to increase,
In Xu Yue's "Records of Numerology", written during the Eastern Han Dynasty,
There are records of abacus calculation,
This marks the gradual formation of abacus calculation.
