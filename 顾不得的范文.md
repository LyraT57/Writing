On a podium, the winner stands triumphantly, arms raised in joy, while stepping on the shoulders of the defeated. Meanwhile, the loser, confronted with such humiliation, feels powerless and resigned. At the bottom of the image, there is a caption that reads: "Such an opponent".

在领奖台上，获胜者得意洋洋，双臂高举，踩着失败者的肩膀。而那位失败者却无奈地面对此般羞辱，感到无能为力和委屈。图画底部有一句话：如此对手。

（2）第二段的观点

Confidence and courage are vital attributes that many young people today unfortunately seem to lack. Throughout our upbringing, many—including myself—have been instilled with the values of politeness and consideration. While these qualities are undeniably important, they often cultivate a reluctance to express genuine needs and an inability to refuse unreasonable demands from others, ultimately leading to a depletion of one’s energy. In recent years, the term "fei qi" has gained traction, embodying a spirit that embraces the challenge of authority, displays unyielding resilience, and resists compromise.

自信勇敢，这是当今许多年轻人缺失的一种重要品质。许多人，甚至包括我，从小到大受到的教育都是：要做一个礼貌懂事的人。这固然没错，但很多人也因此养成了不敢表达自己真实需求、不敢拒绝他人不合理要求的习惯，并不断消耗自己的能量。近年来很流行一个叫“匪气”的词，它代表了一种敢于挑战权威、不妥协、不退缩的精神。

（3）第三段的措施

To foster our own "fei qi," it is imperative to deepen our understanding within a specific area and to engage in continuous exploration, as such knowledge provides the foundation for confidently challenging authority. As the Chinese proverb wisely states, "With reason, one can travel the world."

要想培养自己身上的“匪气”，最重要的一点是，一定要提升自己在某一个领域的认知，并不断深入探索，这是你挑战权威的底气。中国有句古话：有理走遍天下。

量力而行

> In the comic, a wise old man and a curious young boy take center stage. The boy stands before a large pot of water, heated over a fire of sticks, and he asks, “What if we run out of firewood?” The grandfather responds with a twinkle in his eye, “Then simply reduce the amount of water by half.”

> "Knowing one’s limits" is the ability to flexibly adjust goals when faced with difficulties, and it seems to be overlooked by many. Teachers and parents often teach us to face all challenges and hardships in life with strong perseverance, but they may not take into account each child's individual circumstances and abilities. There is an old Chinese saying: "A clever woman cannot cook without rice," which reminds us that while many goals may seem beautiful, if they are disconnected from reality, they will only lead to empty efforts.

不要懒惰

The cartoon depicts two men. One is leaning against a sapling, bending the tender plant. The other, holding a watering can, is about to irrigate the sapling, inquisitively asking, "What are you doing?" The man replies, "Waiting for the enjoying the cool."

漫画中描绘了两个男子。一人倚靠着一株幼小的树苗，将其压弯了。另一人手持水壶，正准备为树苗浇水，好奇地问道：“你在做什么？”  此人回答：“等着乘凉”。你可以积累的一些词：sapling：小树苗（你也可以写a young tree）bend：使弯曲be about to：准备做某事irrigate：浇水enjoy the cool：乘凉

（2）第二段的观点句

To reap without sowing is, at its worst, to steal the fruits of another's labor—a contemptible act.  True happiness isn't a windfall; it's the reward of relentless effort and dedicated toil in the arduous ascent to the summit of one's aspirations.  Embracing the spirit of contribution not only benefits those in need but also serves as the indispensable path to creating personal value and fulfilling one's life's purpose.

坐享其成，往严重了说，就是窃取他人劳动成果——一种卑劣的行为。真正的幸福并非天上掉馅饼，而是为了实现抱负而艰苦攀登过程中不懈努力和辛勤付出的回报。具备付出精神，不仅能帮助有需要的人，更是创造个人价值和实现人生目标的必由之路。


At the dining table, several cats were enjoying their fish when one of them caught sight of a mouse and promptly leapt to catch it. Just at that moment, the cat seated beside it, with a tone of sarcasm, remarked, "In this day and age, we all have fish on our plates. Why on earth would you still want to catch mice?"

在餐桌上，好几只猫正在享用鱼，其中一只猫发现了老鼠，立刻跳起来去捕捉。就在这时，坐在它旁边的那只猫带着讽刺的口吻说道：“在这个年代，我们都有鱼吃了。你怎么还要去捉老鼠呢？”

（2）第二段解释

Upholding one’s professional responsibilities, a quality that may seem ordinary, has become increasingly precious in modern society. In schools, the students who diligently attend classes and study are few and far between, while the majority indulges in gaming, dating, and aimlessness. Similarly, in the workplace, those who take their jobs seriously and act with accountability are in the minority, while evasion of responsibilities and refusal to take ownership have become the norm. 

坚守坚守本职工作，这个听起来再寻常不过的品质，在现代社会已经变得越来越珍贵。学校里，认真听课学习的学生是少数，成天打游戏、谈恋爱、游手好闲的学生成为大多数。职场中，对本职工作认真负责的人是少数，逃避责任、拒绝承担的人成为大多数。

（3）第三段观点

I firmly believe in the saying: sincerity and dedication are the most efficient paths, whereas attempting to be clever only escalates costs and introduces risks. Likewise, while hedonists may experience immediate happiness, in the long run, it is only those who remain true to their principles who can attain the higher-level happiness derived from realizing their life’s potential.

我非常认同这样一句话：真诚并认真是效率最高的路径，耍小聪明只会增加成本和带来风险。同理，那些享乐主义的人，短期来看会过得比较幸福，但长期来看，只有坚守本心的人才能体验到实现人生价值这种更高层次的幸福。
