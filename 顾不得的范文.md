On a podium, the winner stands triumphantly, arms raised in joy, while stepping on the shoulders of the defeated. Meanwhile, the loser, confronted with such humiliation, feels powerless and resigned. At the bottom of the image, there is a caption that reads: "Such an opponent".

在领奖台上，获胜者得意洋洋，双臂高举，踩着失败者的肩膀。而那位失败者却无奈地面对此般羞辱，感到无能为力和委屈。图画底部有一句话：如此对手。

（2）第二段的观点

Confidence and courage are vital attributes that many young people today unfortunately seem to lack. Throughout our upbringing, many—including myself—have been instilled with the values of politeness and consideration. While these qualities are undeniably important, they often cultivate a reluctance to express genuine needs and an inability to refuse unreasonable demands from others, ultimately leading to a depletion of one’s energy. In recent years, the term "fei qi" has gained traction, embodying a spirit that embraces the challenge of authority, displays unyielding resilience, and resists compromise.

自信勇敢，这是当今许多年轻人缺失的一种重要品质。许多人，甚至包括我，从小到大受到的教育都是：要做一个礼貌懂事的人。这固然没错，但很多人也因此养成了不敢表达自己真实需求、不敢拒绝他人不合理要求的习惯，并不断消耗自己的能量。近年来很流行一个叫“匪气”的词，它代表了一种敢于挑战权威、不妥协、不退缩的精神。

（3）第三段的措施

To foster our own "fei qi," it is imperative to deepen our understanding within a specific area and to engage in continuous exploration, as such knowledge provides the foundation for confidently challenging authority. As the Chinese proverb wisely states, "With reason, one can travel the world."

要想培养自己身上的“匪气”，最重要的一点是，一定要提升自己在某一个领域的认知，并不断深入探索，这是你挑战权威的底气。中国有句古话：有理走遍天下。
