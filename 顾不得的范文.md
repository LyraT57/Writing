On a podium, the winner stands triumphantly, arms raised in joy, while stepping on the shoulders of the defeated. Meanwhile, the loser, confronted with such humiliation, feels powerless and resigned. At the bottom of the image, there is a caption that reads: "Such an opponent".

在领奖台上，获胜者得意洋洋，双臂高举，踩着失败者的肩膀。而那位失败者却无奈地面对此般羞辱，感到无能为力和委屈。图画底部有一句话：如此对手。

（2）第二段的观点

Confidence and courage are vital attributes that many young people today unfortunately seem to lack. Throughout our upbringing, many—including myself—have been instilled with the values of politeness and consideration. While these qualities are undeniably important, they often cultivate a reluctance to express genuine needs and an inability to refuse unreasonable demands from others, ultimately leading to a depletion of one’s energy. In recent years, the term "fei qi" has gained traction, embodying a spirit that embraces the challenge of authority, displays unyielding resilience, and resists compromise.

自信勇敢，这是当今许多年轻人缺失的一种重要品质。许多人，甚至包括我，从小到大受到的教育都是：要做一个礼貌懂事的人。这固然没错，但很多人也因此养成了不敢表达自己真实需求、不敢拒绝他人不合理要求的习惯，并不断消耗自己的能量。近年来很流行一个叫“匪气”的词，它代表了一种敢于挑战权威、不妥协、不退缩的精神。

（3）第三段的措施

To foster our own "fei qi," it is imperative to deepen our understanding within a specific area and to engage in continuous exploration, as such knowledge provides the foundation for confidently challenging authority. As the Chinese proverb wisely states, "With reason, one can travel the world."

要想培养自己身上的“匪气”，最重要的一点是，一定要提升自己在某一个领域的认知，并不断深入探索，这是你挑战权威的底气。中国有句古话：有理走遍天下。

量力而行

> In the comic, a wise old man and a curious young boy take center stage. The boy stands before a large pot of water, heated over a fire of sticks, and he asks, “What if we run out of firewood?” The grandfather responds with a twinkle in his eye, “Then simply reduce the amount of water by half.”

> "Knowing one’s limits" is the ability to flexibly adjust goals when faced with difficulties, and it seems to be overlooked by many. Teachers and parents often teach us to face all challenges and hardships in life with strong perseverance, but they may not take into account each child's individual circumstances and abilities. There is an old Chinese saying: "A clever woman cannot cook without rice," which reminds us that while many goals may seem beautiful, if they are disconnected from reality, they will only lead to empty efforts.

不要懒惰

The cartoon depicts two men. One is leaning against a sapling, bending the tender plant. The other, holding a watering can, is about to irrigate the sapling, inquisitively asking, "What are you doing?" The man replies, "Waiting for the enjoying the cool."

漫画中描绘了两个男子。一人倚靠着一株幼小的树苗，将其压弯了。另一人手持水壶，正准备为树苗浇水，好奇地问道：“你在做什么？”  此人回答：“等着乘凉”。你可以积累的一些词：sapling：小树苗（你也可以写a young tree）bend：使弯曲be about to：准备做某事irrigate：浇水enjoy the cool：乘凉

（2）第二段的观点句

To reap without sowing is, at its worst, to steal the fruits of another's labor—a contemptible act.  True happiness isn't a windfall; it's the reward of relentless effort and dedicated toil in the arduous ascent to the summit of one's aspirations.  Embracing the spirit of contribution not only benefits those in need but also serves as the indispensable path to creating personal value and fulfilling one's life's purpose.

坐享其成，往严重了说，就是窃取他人劳动成果——一种卑劣的行为。真正的幸福并非天上掉馅饼，而是为了实现抱负而艰苦攀登过程中不懈努力和辛勤付出的回报。具备付出精神，不仅能帮助有需要的人，更是创造个人价值和实现人生目标的必由之路。
